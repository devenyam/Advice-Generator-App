# This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db)

You'd have to receive the **_advice_** via an API in order to complete the task. However, because I am not yet familiar with API, I created an array named adviceAPI and stored a few pieces of advise in it.
